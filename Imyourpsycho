Close your eyes
Hear my heart
You can’t see my lies

Gonna tell a lie
Through my eyes
You will never know

Gave me your all
I will take your heart
And I’ll rip it all
All away

Close your heart
Before too late
Maybe I’m insane

Gonna tell a lie
You deny
They already know

Gave me your all
And I’ll take your heart
Leave them all behind
‘hind the walls
schizoprenic psychopath
its okay to not to be okay.
