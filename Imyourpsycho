Close your eyes
Hear my heart
You can’t see my lies

Gonna tell a lie
Through my eyes
You will never know

Gave me your all
I will take your heart
And I’ll rip it all
All away

Close your heart
Before too late
Maybe I’m insane

Gonna tell a lie
You deny
They already know

Gave me your all
And I’ll take your heart
Leave them all behind
‘hind the walls
schizoprenic psychopath
